**Nashville Sound Spot** is my front-end capstone project for Nashville Software School. It's a simple project designed for getting more practice at using the fundamentals of mainly the React library, but also styling with bootstrap.

## Premise of the project

Nashville Sound Spot is designed to be a basic local bands-in-town type of app, where a user can add their band/bands to their profile, and display more information about them, along with what shows they are playing in Nashville area; and other users can save their favorite bands, venues, and discover new bands based on their favorite genres.

## Development

The project was developed using the React library, and styled using a combination of standard bootstrap, along with custom CSS rules. It uses json-server to store and access data, and the react-router-dom package for navigation.
